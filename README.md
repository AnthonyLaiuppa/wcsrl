# Word Cloud Reddit Saved Links

This is a work in progress

So far I just needed to get the OAuth2 exchange established so we can grab the links from the reddit user to make the wordcloud

...and hey it works, yay! 

Ill be coming back to clean all this code up eventually....

//TODO
Build basic Bootstrap front end
Add more views and some loading bars
Get the deployment automated into a container
Throw a nice dynamic JS front end together (If I have too much time on my hands)
